The dataset for this script was rather large and I didn't feel like fighting the upload, so I'll provide a link for the dataset download from Kaggle.com user
Paul Mooney.  All credit for the dataset goes to him and his affiliates

I would suggest using a high speed ethernet connection for the download, or it might take all day
